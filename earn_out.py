'''
This project is to use Monte Carlo simulation to price earn out.

The product information: From and after the receipt by the investors of aggregate proceeds in respect to the Class A units that exceed the product of
(i) 2.50 multiplied by (ii) the investorsâ€™ investment amount in the Class A units, at such time as there are proceeds actually
paid, the buyer shall promptly pay to the sellers an amount equal to 25.0% of the available proceed until such time as the
sellers have received an aggregate amount equal to $20,000,000. --cited from https://cdn.hl.com/pdf/2023/emerging-trends--earnout-structured-as-equity.pdf

# parameters assumptions:
# Initial Investment: $300M
# Earn out period: after 5 years
# 12% annual discount rate
